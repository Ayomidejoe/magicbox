How to make a new GitHub repository
***********************************

This section explains steps to follow when creating a new GitHub repository.
These makes projects more organized, easier to follow from an outsider's perspective, and boosts visibility of development.

Repository creation
===================

These steps focus on the initial repository creation, from `github.com/new <https://github.com/new>`_.

#. **Set a meaningful name**:

    - Try to make purpose obvious in title

    - Use hyphens (``-``) instead of underscores (``_``)

#. **Write a description**: Write one or two sentences to quickly describe the project

#. **Initialize with README**: Check to add a ``README.md`` file

    - If one is not yet written, initialize one

#. **Add .gitignore for project type**: Find project's programming language and choose its ``.gitignore`` file, if available

#. **Add BSD-3 Clause license**: Standard license used for UNICEF Innovation projects

Configure repository
====================

Now, the repository is created.
Make sure these settings are updated:

Disable unneeded tools
----------------------

Disable any unneeded features or repository tools.
If they are needed, they can be turned on again later.
Turning off unneeded features makes it easier for someone to find the useful places in the project.
It can also indicate if the thing they are looking for (e.g. documentation) is somewhere else.

These features are found under the *Settings* menu for every repository.

   Disable unneeded tools, like a wiki or project boards.
   There may be documentation or project boards set up elsewhere.
   This does not disable organization-level project boards.

Set description, URL, topic tags
--------------------------------

Make sure every repository has a description and topic tags set.
If there is a URL to view a demo of the project or read more about it, include it too.

At the top of every GitHub repository, there are fields of metadata for a description, a URL, and topic tags.
A description and URL helps someone understand tge project in one or two sentences or see a live demo.
Topic tags raise visibility in the GitHub ecosystem and help other people discover new projects.

.. figure:: /_static/github-workflow-description-tags-empty.png
   :alt: Example of no description, URL, or topic tags

   Example of no description, URL, or topic tags

Do not leave a repository empty like this.
Use the *Edit* button on the right to change the description and URL.
Two text boxes will appear.

For topic tags, click *Add topics* towards the left.
Choose tags related to your project to help identify it.
Consider programming languages, frameworks, or other software used.
Tags like ``humanitarian`` or ``united-nations`` are also examples of tags for types of software.

Set up useful labels
====================

Labels are visual organization tools for your GitHub project.
They make issues easier to sort and prioritize tasks.
Additionally, they also help new contributors identify areas of interest for your project.
They can help improve awareness of different types of contribution methods in your project (e.g. design and documentation tasks).

Configure each repository's labels in a way that makes sense for your project.
The labels should mean something to *you* so they are easily applied for sorting later.
Every repository's issue and pull request labels are found under the *Issues* tab with the *Labels* button.

.. figure:: /_static/github-workflow-labels-menu.png
   :alt: Click the Labels button towards the right of the search bar

   Click the *Labels* button towards the right of the search bar

A good example of labels is `here <https://github.com/unicef/magicbox/labels>`_ on the `unicef/magicbox`_ repository. (To view the color code for a given label, click the "Edit" on its row.)

Not all of these labels will be helpful for a new project.
Take ones that make sense, and make new labels specific to the project, if needed.

.. _set-up-ci:

Set up continuous integration (CI)
==================================
After his research, @jwflory - one of our former interns - `decided <https://github.com/unicef/magicbox-aggregate-mobility/issues/11>`_ to select Travis CI for our repos. Below is how you are going to add this service to a repo:

1. Make sure you have the admin access to the repo. (New core developers can gain such access across multiple repos if @mikefab or one of the people in charge adds them to the `MagicBox Admins team <https://github.com/orgs/unicef/teams/magicbox-admins/members>`_.)

2. If you are *not* on Travis CI yet, browse to `travis-ci.com <https://travis-ci.com/>`_ and log in with your GitHub account. Along the way, you will have the option to add any repo to Travis CI. Select "Only select repositories" and choose ``unicef/<the-repo-of-interest>`` from the drop-down list. **NOTE**: As of 07/2018, we still go by handpicking repos rather than adding every repo to Travis CI, although this policy might change in the future. Once you arrive at your Travis CI Profile page, you will see the list of all repos currently under Travis CI tracking (whether from your personal account or the unicef GitHub account).

3. Now go to the repo's home page, click on the **Settings** tab, then select **Integrations & services** from the left-side menu. If everything is properly set up in the previous step, you should see Travis CI under the Installed GitHub Apps.

4. Go to the root directory of the repo and add a new file called ``.travis.yml``. Place the following content in that file:
::

  language: node_js
  node_js:
    - "8"
  cache:
    directories:
      - "node_modules"

(If all of this doesn't make sense, use the following `Getting Started guide <https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/>`_ by Travis CI.)

5. Last step is to add the Travis CI badge to the repo's README. Go to the Travis CI page of the repo - the URL probably looks like this: ``htps://travis-ci.com/unicef/the-repo-of-interest``. Find the status symbol (the little bar to the right of the Octocat) next to your repo's name. Click on it to generate the code block you'll put into your README, by selecting Markdown from the second dropdown menu when the Status Image window pops up (see the guide `here <https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/status-images/>`_).
Copy the code snippet and place it on top of your repo's README file, just under the repo's name.

.. _set-up-code-health-checks:

Set up code health checks with CodeClimate
==========================================

We use CodeClimate for our projects. What this does is that ... Below is how you are going to add this service to a repo:
   - Similar to above, you need admin access to carry out this task.
   - Go to the repo home page, click "Settings" tab > select "Integrations & services" from the left-side menu, then add .... Then select the "Webhooks" tab, add a new webhook using the webhook URL.
(if all of this doesn't make sense, use the guide from CodeClimate here: )
   - Enable/Configure the Test Coverage service: ...
   - Add the Maintainability and the Test Coverage badges to the repo's README: ...

***********************************
How to maintain a GitHub repository
***********************************

This section focuses on "housekeeping" with GitHub projects, including labels and project boards.

Housekeeping is important to maintain a repository.
This organizes bugs, feature requests, and the project itself.
Organized projects help active contributors stay on track and make realistic deadlines.
It also helps new contributors understand what is going on.

Housekeeping has five parts:

#. Issue metadata

#. Adding labels

#. Updating project boards

#. Making pull requests

#. Reviewing pull requests

Update issue and pull request metadata
======================================

Every GitHub issue and pull request has four metadata properties:

#. **Assignees**: Who is currently working on this and who is the best point-of-contact for updates

#. **Labels**: Visual cues on task status and importance (see below)

#. **Projects**: Advanced business process management (see below)

#. **Milestone**: Relevant feature or version milestone for an issue or pull request

Assignees and labels should always be used at a minimum.
Use projects and milestones when they are available.

   :alt: Set assignees, labels, project boards, and milestones from the side column in every GitHub issue or pull request

   Set assignees, labels, project boards, and milestones from the side column in every GitHub issue or pull request

Adding labels to issues
=======================

Above, labels were mentioned as part of issue and pull request metadata.
Maintaining and using labels is a good habit.
An issue or pull request might have two to four labels, depending on how the project was set up.

If labels are not yet configured, read `Set up useful labels`_.

Once a week, check issues and pull requests to see if tags are up-to-date.
Update or change any labels that are stale (such as priority labels).
Add labels from the metadata sub-menu when you open an issue or pull request.

Updating project boards
=======================

`GitHub project boards <https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/>`_ are an organizational tool for the project.
They use a `kanban-style <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)>`_ approach to organizing GitHub issues and pull requests.
Our workflow is explained `on Opensource.com <https://opensource.com/article/18/4/keep-your-project-organized-git-repo>`_.

To update and maintain the project boardsâ€¦

#. Make sure any issues or pull requests not shown are added to the board

#. Ensure important issues are organized by *In progress* or *To Do*

#. Issues not yet ready for consideration go on the backlog

#. All items under *In progress* or *To Do* columns should be GitHub issues, **not** note cards (note cards are okay for the backlog column)

Making pull requests
====================

All major changes to the project should **always be made through a pull request** (PR).
Pull requests are like a registry of changes for a project.
It is easy for someone to see what is going in and out of a project.
Outside contributors will always have to make pull requests, so it is good practice for core / trusted developers to use pull requests too.

Follow contributing guidelines
------------------------------

The contributing guidelines for all MagicBox projects live `in the unicef/magicbox repository <https://github.com/unicef/magicbox/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.

Always follow these contributing guidelines when working in the project.
These are the standards and rules we ask the community to follow when contributing.
As project maintainers, it is our responsibility to hold ourselves to the same standards we ask of others.
Thus, always make sure current development practices are in-line with what our guidelines.

Write useful commit messages
----------------------------

Writing useful commit messages is a good practice to follow.
When looking through project commits, it should be somewhat clear what has changed in the project and how.
Short or nondescript commit messages are not helpful to maintainers or new contributors.
Commit messages do not need to be paragraphs, but they should clearly indicate what changed or why something changed.

Read `this blog post <https://nathanleclaire.com/blog/2014/09/14/dont-be-scared-of-git-rebase/>`_ for more information about keeping git history clean and tidy with ``git rebase``.

Reviewing pull requests
=======================

Pull requests (often abbreviated as PRs) are the cornerstone of accepting contributions to countless open source projects.
All major contributions to a project, from both core contributors and new contributors, should be made as pull requests.
It is important to follow consistent practices when reviewing pull requests.

Triage new pull requests
------------------------

Update the metadata for all new pull requests, especially if they will be open for *longer than one work day*.
Examples of metadata includes the following:

- **Assignees**: Indicates whose responsibility it is to review or accept a pull request

- **Labels**: Indicates what type of change the pull request is and what its priority is

- **Projects**: Provides context to overall project development (if using project boards)

- **Milestones**: Connects pull request to a specific goal or version (if applicable)

Triaging new pull requests by updating the metadata keeps the project organized.
It is easier for an outsider to understand the project workflow and development by triaging.
It is also helpful to give context for a pull request if you have to update it later.
For example, if a pull request cannot be merged because of an external problem, label it as **blocked**.

Use continuous integration (CI)
-------------------------------

Use the CI added :ref:`in the previous section <set-up-ci>` as a basic requirement for accepting new contributions.
All pull requests will run your test suite and ensure new contributions pass all tests.
This prevents bad code from slipping under the cracks and making it into a production environment.
It also provides quick, instant feedback for a new contribution.
The contributor immediately knows their change broke the application and know test is not passing.

For *all* new contributions, from both active and new contributors, ensure all CI tests pass before merging a pull request.
Bypassing CI health checks by pushing directly to the repository or merging a pull request before tests finish bypasses the advantages of CI.


Use code health checks
----------------------

Use the code health checks added :ref:`earlier in this section <set-up-code-health-checks>` as another requirement for accepting new contributions.
There are many ways for you to configure the code health checks.
Use them as a way to set standards for code quality and enforce those standards automatically in new contributions.
The code health checks offer both already active and new contributors a way to understand the impact of their changes.
This results in clear code that is easier to maintain in the long-term.

Ensure all new contributions receive passing grades from the code health checking tool before accepting them.

Leave a review
--------------

Code review is a helpful practice for any software project and team, as explained in `this Atlassian blog post <https://www.atlassian.com/agile/software-development/code-reviews>`_.
It is a chance to catch deeper problems before they enter the code base.
It also provides a chance for mentorship and guidance for a new contributor.
Additionally, it improves the overall health of your project and makes an outside contribution more likely to contribute again.
Taking the time to review someone's contribution and code is also validation of their time and energy spent to make that contribution.

Spending the time to review new contributions should be as regular of a practice as writing your own code.
Ensure each new pull request receives a review, even if it is a passing review with no comments.
If you do leave feedback, make sure it is kind and courteous â€“ be aware of how you deliver your feedback.
See `this guide <https://medium.freecodecamp.org/unlearning-toxic-behaviors-in-a-code-review-culture-b7c295452a3c>`_ on unlearning toxic behavior in code reviews.

Always remember to thank a contributor for their contribution too.


*******************************
Communicating about development
*******************************

Communication about development should be kept public as much as possible in `our Gitter chat <https://gitter.im/unicef-innovation-dev/Lobby>`_.
Whenever you make a new pull request, always share the link in the main Gitter chat room.
This lets other developers know you made a change and also gives them an opportunity to review your code.
And if you want a code review, be sure to ask for it too.
